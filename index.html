                    <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p>Over the course of the summer of 2022 I worked in a group of 4 to design, build, and program a robot from scratch. This robot would then compete in a competition to acquire plastic idols along the course. The course consisted of 3 sections, line following, IR tracking, and ziplines. Almost every part of the robot was manufactured in the lab using a variety of tools such as a laser cutter, lathe, milling machine and 3D printer. The robot was controlled using a STM32 Bluepill, along with several other circuits that constructed by my teammates and I. Several circuits required extensive testing and troubleshooting using an oscilloscope to identify faulty signals. Upon completing the necassary circuits, I wrote firmware used to detect idols along the course using sonar sensing, and control linear robot arm and claws to reach and grab the idol. Integration of the subsystems, such as the robot arm, was by far the most challenging part of the competition, consuming full days of work to test and implement simple features. Nonetheless, our team placed fourth in the competition, despite being down a team member for more than half of the build time. </p>

                    <h4>Engineering Physics machine learning competition</h4>
                    <p>This project was created for the purpose of developing skills in machine learning and computer vision, using a simulated environment in Gazebo. The robot, seen in Fig. 5 drove around the simulated course while viewing license plates on the cars scattered on the edges of the path. Each time the robot saw a license plate, it published the plate and parking spot number to a script that would keep score for each license plate seen. The robot was controlled using an imitation learning model which published ROS command velocities to the robot from a Python script running OpenCV image processing on the robots camera. The neural net was trained from data collected by my teammate and I, driving manually around the course. Over 25,000 images were collected, along with data points for each command velocity seen during itâ€™s respective image. Another Python script running OpenCV processing on the camera, was attempting to identify contours that resembled the front of the cars. Whenever this occurred, two other imitation models were used to read the license plate and parking spot number. This whole project file structure was developed in Linux and managed using Git. </p>
